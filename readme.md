## Web Security
There are many aspects of website securities. The below list contains only ones of those aspects.

- **HTTPS**: HTTPS (HyperText Transfer Protocol Secure) is an encrypted version of the HTTP protocol. It uses SSL or TLS to encrypt all communication between a client and a server. This secure connection allows clients to safely exchange sensitive data with a server.

- **CORS**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is an HTTP-header based mechanism that allows a server to indicate any other origins (domain, scheme, or port) than its own from which a browser should permit loading of resources.

- **Content Security Policy**: Content Security Policy (CSP) is an added layer of security that helps to detect and mitigate certain types of attacks, including Cross Site Scripting (XSS) and data injection attacks.

- **Session/Cookie**: An HTTP cookie (web cookie, browser cookie) is a small piece of data that a server sends to the user’s web browser. The browser may store it and send it back with later requests to the same server. It is used primarily for session management.

- **AuthN/AuthZ**: Authentication is the process of verifying who a user is, while authorization is the process of verifying what they have access to.

- **Secret Key Management**: Secrets management refers to the tools and methods for managing digital authentication credentials (secrets), e.g. passwords, keys, APIs, and tokens.

- **OWASP Security Risks**: The Open Web Application Security Project® (OWASP) is a non-profit organization that is proficient in the field of web application security. It provides the list of critical security concerns for web application security.
